## Python
The presented files within this Python Branch are all python based Data Structure I have done in the past. Not all are complete in full but are mostly completed.
If there are questions about any of the provided information please feel free to reach out VIA email. Most of what you see in this location is not project based.

## C++/C/Arduino
Anything in this branch is directly related to projects that have been done in free time and are free to pull if desired. Everything that is posted here is free use.
Note that some of this information is paired with a CAD file that has a 3D model associated. For more information on this please direct to the readme associated. 

P.S: I do a a lot of arduino coding in my freetime. I only really upload code here for projects I feel are considered a completed project. 

## Games:
This location mainly contains python based game files. I am looking to at some point also adding in some C++ and C games.

## CAD_Files 
This location contains some of the more pristine work that has been done in my hobby of 3D printing. Some are associated with coding projects while others are 
standalone. 

## PCB Design
May correlate with seperate files. This is an implementation in works.

## Rust
A language that is currently being learned. Have little to no experience as of the time of this posting.

## Projects
This location contains the completed projects for easier accessibility.
